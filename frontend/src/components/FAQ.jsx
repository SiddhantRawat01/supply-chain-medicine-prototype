      question: "How does blockchain technology ensure drug authenticity?",
      answer: "Our system creates an immutable digital ledger of every drug's journey from manufacturer to patient. Each product is assigned a unique cryptographic identifier that's recorded on the blockchain, making counterfeiting virtually impossible."
    },
    {
        question: "Which pharmaceutical companies are using this system?",
        answer: "We partner with over 50 major pharmaceutical manufacturers globally. The list grows monthly as more companies adopt blockchain for drug authentication to combat counterfeiting."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I verify medications purchased internationally?",
        answer: "Yes, our system works globally. As long as the medication has been registered in our blockchain network, you can verify its authenticity regardless of where it was purchased."
      },
      {
        question: "How often is the blockchain updated with new medications?",
        answer: "Manufacturers update the blockchain in real-time as new batches are produced and shipped. There's typically no more than a 1-hour delay between physical production and blockchain registration."
      },
      {
        question: "What devices can I use to verify medications?",
        answer: "You can use our mobile app (iOS and Android) or access our web portal through any modern browser. Our system is optimized for both smartphones and desktop computers."
